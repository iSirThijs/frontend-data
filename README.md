# Frontend Data - NMVW Creator Bubbles
![bubbles](https://github.com/iSirThijs/frontend-data/wiki/images/endresultScreen.png)

## Features and concept
This visualization is about exploring the photographic collection from the NVMW split out on the person who made the photo. The lager the bubble, the more items in the collection are from that creator and made interactive by clicking on the bubble to get more info on that creator. The overlay can also be changed depending on the layer selected (acedemic title, male/female etc.)

This concept is a continuation of the concept from the previous subject [Functional Programming](https://github.com/iSirThijs/functional-programming/wiki)

# Resit
During grading this assignment, the one thing missing was the documentation. This should have been on the wiki but due to poor timemanagement and constrains I wasn't able to fix it. The only thing necessary for this assignment is the updated documentation on the wiki.
