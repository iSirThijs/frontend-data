# Frontend Data
This repo is for the subject frontend-data from the [Tech Track](https://github.com/cmda-tt/course-19-20)

## About this repo
This repo is my work for the subject frontend-data from the tech-track at the HvA. 

This concept is a continuation of the previous subject [Functional Programming](https://github.com/iSirThijs/functional-programming/)

The goal for the subject is to create an interactive visualization of data for the National Museum of World Cultures. 

> Create a data visualisation (using the d3 library) based on given data where data can be explored through interaction using enter, update, and exit. *- [Tech Track CMDA: Assignment](https://github.com/cmda-tt/course-19-20/blob/master/frontend-data/assessment.md#assignment)*

## Features and concept
This visualization is about exploring the photographic collection from the NVMW split out on the person who made the photo. The lager the bubble, the more items in the collection are from that creator and made interactive by clicking on the bubble to get more info on that creator. The overlay can also be changed depending on the layer selected (acedemic title, male/female etc.)
